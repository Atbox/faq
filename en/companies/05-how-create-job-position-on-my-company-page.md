### How can I crate a job page for my company? ###
Click on the + icon on top of the page and click on [Create a job opportunity](https://atbox.io/job/new). If you already have access to a company page, choose it or [create one](https://atbox.io/company/new).  
Provide information about the job and publish it. Now you can share that page to get job applications.
