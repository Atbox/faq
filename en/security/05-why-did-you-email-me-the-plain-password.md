### Why did you email me the plain password? that's not safe. ###
That's a temporary password. Each Atbox account has a unique email address and we consider the owner of email address as the owner of that Atbox account (even if the account was created by someone else). If you don't choose a password while registering for atbox, we will send you a temporary password so you can login to Atbox and [choose a new password](https://atbox.io/settings).
